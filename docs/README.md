# Diagramer

Statically compiled binary that is easy and fast to render diagrams.

## Motivation

Using Mermaid CLI to render a documentation website is so slow, it is unfeasible to perform in repeat. Diagramer exposes the components of its CLI inside importable packages. It is possible to bundle into Go based static website generators.

## Supported diagrams

Only a popular subset of Mermaid diagrams will be supported. First goal is sequence diagrams.

## Syntax

The accepted syntax would be simplified version of Mermaid diagrams with some additions.

## Exporting

To be determined.

## Contributions

Issues are welcome.
